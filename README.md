# smart-altert-system-for-drivers
In order to ensure pedestrian safety and vehicle speed limits in areas with high pedestrian density/residential areas, a system to detect the traffic density/ school areas/ residential areas and accordingly warns the driver about the speed limit for vehicles using vision based systems which sense the speed limit signs or sign boards for schools/hospitals/accident prone areas etc. and may decide upon the safe speed value with which the vehicle need to operate. The system provides a warning to the driver, if the speed limits are breached.

This project presents the basic utilities for alerting a driver through computer based vision systems, designed at student level.

The functionalities of this system are confined to limited alterting systems like.

 > Warning the drivers when they approach the accident prone areas.(corresponding files are present in folder "Acc_prone_areas")
 
 > Drowsiness detecting system, which produces an alarm when the drives gets drowsy(corresponding files are present in folder "Drowsiness detection")
 
 > One the encounters we had in implementing the project was increasing the FPS of the vision based system so as to make it compatible with dynamic screen capturing.(corresponding    files are present in folder "increasing_fps")
 
 >The final utility of the system is detection sign boards and pedestrains(corresponding files are present in file "obj_detection.rar")
